This is a Python Project template for quickly setting up the basic structure of a Python project.

Please perform the following initialization tasks:

1. Search the entire project for `placeholder` and replace it with the actual value.
2. Ensure that `poetry` is installed.
3. Run `poetry install --no-root --with dev,test` in the project root directory to install dependencies.
4. Run `poetry run pre-commit install` in the project root directory to install pre-commit hooks.
